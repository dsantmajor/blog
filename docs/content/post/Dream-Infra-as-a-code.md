### <span style="color:blue"> The Vision </span>



I would love to build an environment that is agnostic enough to be deployed anywhere with zero modifications . An environment that is scalable on demand . Resilient to attacks ,build with highest standards of security. Flexible enough to adapt to change.
#### <span style="color:blue"> Agnostic</span>

What I mean by agnostic ? It means that i can spin a minimal viable stack on a laptop ,a physical infrastructure ,a cloud provider like AWS ,Azure ,Google Cloud Platform.
#### <span style="color:blue"> Scalable</span>

As load increases or decreases it can spin up or down environments on demands ,
If topology changes are required it is easy to adapt.

#### <span style="color:blue"> Secure</span>


#### <span style="color:blue"> Flexible</span>


#### <span style="color:blue"> Disaster resilient *Phoenix Servers*</span>

That is we can tear it down, something like a chaos monkey ,and it can rise from the ashes wihout any manual interventions or changes
